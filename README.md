# Pass-Cmder
*Read as Password Commander*

It is a CLI application to save and manage credentials on command line. All the data is stored in plain text files, but encryted.

# Implementation
It is supposed to be a programming exercise. I will probably rewrite it using other libraries or even frameworks.
